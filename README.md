 This project functions to compare two files
 in fibonacciPrime sequenced byte numbers or all consecutive byte numbers. Has the
 commandline options to print results to a results.txt file or console. Also contains
 timer clock() to indicate the time processed for each instance of compare. Info.
 that are printed for each file compare are target/prospect file name, file size,
 percent match for the primeFibonacci compare. The primeFibonacci compare will also
 print the characters being compared, which characters matched, and the byte number.
 Any tab, enter, or blank space before the first character in any file will be ignored.
